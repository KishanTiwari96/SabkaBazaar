## Firebase Authentication Setup

### Frontend Setup
The frontend is already configured with Firebase client SDK to support Google authentication.

### Backend Setup
1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project (e-commerce-a53a8)
3. Go to Project Settings > Service accounts
4. Click "Generate new private key" to download a JSON file containing your Firebase service account credentials
5. Open the downloaded JSON file and update the environment variables in your backend wrangler.jsonc file:

```json
"FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID": "your-project-id", // Copy from the JSON file
"FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY": "your-private-key", // Copy the entire private_key value from the JSON file
"FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL": "your-service-account-email" // Copy from the JSON file (ends with @your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com)
```

6. Make sure the private key includes the begin and end markers:
```
"FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIEvgIBA... ...your full key here... ...3DR55uNw==\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
```

7. If you continue to have issues, try URL encoding the private key or removing newlines manually

### Troubleshooting Google Sign-in
If you see 401 Unauthorized errors after attempting to sign in:
1. Check browser console for detailed error messages
2. Verify your Firebase service account has the "Firebase Authentication Admin" role
3. Make sure you're using the correct service account email and private key
4. Check your backend logs for more detailed error information

### Testing the Google Authentication
1. Run the backend: `cd backend && npm run dev`
2. Run the frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. Click "Sign in with Google" button in the login page
4. Complete the Google login flow
5. You should be redirected to the homepage after successful login
